# IB RPG

> The tavern is lively and warm. A great hearth is surrounded by people in ancient wooden chairs, each different in design from the last. Some sit on the ornate rugs and furs, looking intently on the fire.

> There are some in the darker corners, watching the room. others are staring intently into long empty mugs.

> There are still plenty of empty tables, and at the bar sit only a handful of people nursing drinks. The barkeeper is cheery and idling chatting with the one nearest the entrance.

> As you size up the room, curious eyes flicker about. Everyone here has the same question...

> **Who are you?**
