# Welcome!

> The tavern is lively and warm. A great hearth is surrounded by ancient wooden chairs, each as battered, weary, and unique as the people sitting in them.
>
> Some sit on the ornate rugs and furs, looking intently on the fire.
>
> Others remain in the still, dark corners. Watching the room.
>
> There are plenty of open tables, a handful of people sit nursing drinks. The barkeeper is cheery and idly chatting with another patron.
>
> As you size up the room, curious eyes flicker about. Everyone here has the same question...
>
> **Who are you?**
