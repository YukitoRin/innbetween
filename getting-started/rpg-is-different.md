## The Problems of Group Storytelling

One of the many nuances of storytelling that isn't immediately obvious _\(though it seems that way once someone points it out\)_ is that for every main character of a story, the author must construct a story arc.

Similarly, an obvious _\(yet often overlooked\)_ aspect of tabletop RPGs is the fact that every player is both an author and a main character. This is especially true of FATE.

The result can be beautiful, it can be messy, but most importantly: it can be directed.

And ultimately, most players _\(in my humble experience\)_ want to play the game while GMs want to tell a story. These goals must be reconciled.

I have some recommendations below, but they mostly boil down to:

* be present
* be prepared
* be patient

## Setting up for Success

Here are some simple points to set yourself up for success. I have listed them in _\(what I have found to be\)_ order of importance.

### GMs

* **Know your players**. Your first games together will probably not be super organized or predictable. Starting with some short one shots or premade modules will serve you well until you can better understand who you are running the game for.
* **Know the rules**. Players are more ready to accept and respect you if you are confident. You are the rules arbiter, take the time to be a good one.
* **Care about the player characters** at least as much as the world. Remember that bit at the start about storytelling? Characters changing gives birth to story. If you want a compelling traditional story you need \(at least\) flawed characters and a world that challenges those flaws. Even if you run a sandbox, your plot hooks should try to direct players to the places where they have to face themselves, each other, and the world. Try to use mechanics which they have \(or have not\) prepared for to challenge or reward their choices.
* **Know your own characters**. Whether they are yours or the players. A little preparation can go a long way. Whether you roll up random npc's, write each character personally, or have some general characteristics you draw from as needed, make sure you are well practiced with plugging believable characters into your world.

### Players

* **Know the other players**. What experience are they trying to have, and how can you fit into it? Do you challenge it? Support it? How can you engage with their characters without hijacking their story? The GMs job is to try to make you a compelling main character, but _only you can make yourself a compelling supporting cast member_.
* **Know the story** that your GM will be trying to tell. If there are documents they send you, try to read them as much as possible. If the GM is ok with some critique, it can be helpful to let your GM know which documents held your attention the best and which you maybe skimmed or skipped _\(that information will help them as they craft the story\)_.
* **Know your own character**. Even if you hate the character creation process, it is your responsibility to craft a character you will enjoy playing. The next section has some advice for this process.
* **Know the basic mechanics of the game** and how your character makes use of them. The more familiar you are with these, the faster and smoother gameplay will be.
