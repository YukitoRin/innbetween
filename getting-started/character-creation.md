# Character Creation

In the simplest sense, **character creation is just checking items off of a glorified checklist**. But there are many strategies for where to begin and how to go about it.

What I list below are merely two strategies I use to start (aesthetic or mechanic), and the one I always use to finish (reciprocating). You'll note that they are entirely different from FATE's "creation as play" method. While I think their method is elegant, I have consistently had trouble using it with new players and players that struggle with role-playing.

**"and...", "but...", and "because..." are your best friends** both as a player and as a GM. They are staples in improv for a reason. Try to make everything compliment and contrast, compound and confound, do what you can to connect and relate them.

For character creation, you should **look for a core and build off of it** one piece at a time. What you choose as your core will color the creation process, but shouldn't prevent you from making something compelling. Most good cores fall into the category of "mechanics" or "aesthetics."

## By Aesthetic
> "I know how I want to play my character from a narrative standpoint. I have an idea of how they look, act, and/or the roleplaying experience I want to have."

Choose a CORE that is a...

- narrative archetype
- role-playing style
- fictional character inspiration
- compelling backstory or relationship
- cool sounding aspect

## By Mechanic
> "I know how I want to play my character from a gameplay standpoint. I have an idea of something cool they can do and/or the role I want to fill in the party."

Choose a CORE that is a...

- role within the party (eg. "healer")
- stunt that sounds cool
- extra or item you want to have

## From Blank Sheet to Character Sheet
> Once you know your CORE, you must build the makings of a character atop it. A trouble for narrative strength, cool stunts for gameplay strength, and a place in the setting for immersion strength.

1. **Write down your CORE** below your High Concept in the Description field. It may turn into an aspect, High Concept, or backstory later on.
2. **Come up with a stunt** that represents a cool thing you can do and supports your CORE.
3. **Decide on a challenging situation** for your character. Pick something you know will come up in general play (convincing someone, running into battle, fleeing a battle, aiding the weak, challenging the strong, etc).
4. **Make up a Trouble** that will make it challenging to (or challenging _not_ to) use your cool stunt or fulfill your role in the situation you decided on in the last step.
6. **Decide on a profession** that would naturally complement or contrast the character's role or cool stunt. Make it into an aspect.
7. **Ask the GM about the setting**. How might someone in this world become a character similar to what you have outlined. Come up with at least 3 different ways your character could come about.
8. **Settle on one of the identities** from the last step as a final backstory. Use it to create 1 general purpose aspect, one more stunt, and to finalize your High Concept.
9. **Fill in your skills**. You need one "Great" skill, two "Good" skills, three "Fair" skills, and four "Average" skills. The rest are 0 by default. Make the Great skill and at least two of three of the others point back to your High Concept. The rest can be random flavor, tie into backstory elements, or relate to stunts as desired.

Example In Paragraph Form:

> "My character is `a healer` _and_ `because I am a healer I can cure poison or internal ailments with a tonic`, _but_ I am `afraid of the sight of blood and external trauma` _and_ this makes it difficult for me to help those who need me most. This weakness is _compounded_ by an `upbringing in a noble house`. Of the 7 noble houses I was `born to the lowest house: Albens`, who spent their time and fortune caring for the elderly, infirm, and poor _and_ `Because I grew up helping those in need I get +2 to EMPATHY rolls against/for those I am trying to help`..."

Notice how everything is a natural expansion of the character's past and identity. In particular, the circumstances leading to their Trouble (born to a noble house and thus afraid of physical trauma) also leads to their defining and interesting abilities (empathy when helping and ability to heal internal injury). In this case I built them backwards (mechanics leading to character) but by making each piece a natural extension of other pieces the character still feels like it has a place in the world beyond "generic cleric person".

The order of these steps is flexible, but if you run into someone who has no clue where to start, run them through the "By Mechanic" style method one step at a time and they should come out with a compelling character.
