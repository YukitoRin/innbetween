# Character Creation

In the simplest sense, **character creation is just checking items off of a glorified checklist**. But there are many strategies for where to begin and how to go about it. What I list below are merely two strategies I use to start (aesthetic or mechanic), and the one I always use to finish (reciprocating).

**"and..." alongside "but..." are your best friends** both as a player and as a GM. They are staples in improv for a reason. Try to make everything compliment and contrast, compound and confound, do what you can to relate them.

For character creation, you should look for a nucleus and build off of it one piece at a time, continually adding onto each piece. **Here is an example** of the [By Mechanic](#by-mechanic) method detailed below.

> "My character is `a healer` _and_ `because I am a healer I can cure poison or internal ailments with a tonic`, _but_ I am `afraid of the sight of blood and external trauma` _and_ this makes it difficult for me to help those who need me most. This weakness is _compounded_ by an `upbringing in a noble house`. Of the 7 noble houses I was `born to the lowest house: Albens`, who spent their time and fortune caring for the elderly, infirm, and poor _and_ `Because I grew up helping those in need I get +2 to EMPATHY rolls against/for those I am trying to help`..."

Notice how everything is a natural expansion of the character's past and identity. In particular, the circumstances leading to their Trouble (born to a noble house and thus afraid of physical trauma) also leads to their defining and interesting abilities (empathy when helping and ability to heal internal injury). In this case I built them backwards (mechanics leading to character) but by making each piece a natural extension of other pieces the character still feels like it has a place in the world beyond "generic cleric person".

Personally I prefer the "By Aesthetic" method, but I have found that for new players, or people who struggle with role-playing, the "By Mechanic" method is a more productive option.

## By Aesthetic
> I know how I want to play my character from a narrative standpoint. I have an idea of how they look, act, and/or the roleplaying experience I want to have.

## By Mechanic
> I know how I want to play my character from a gameplay standpoint. I have an idea of something cool they can do and/or the role I want to fill in the party.

1. Write your role at the start of your High Concept if you have one in mind. Otherwise keep this blank.
2. Come up with an a stunt that represents the cool thing you can do, or supports your chosen role.
3. Decide on a situation that will challenge your character. Pick something you know will come up in general play (convincing someone, running into battle, fleeing a battle, aiding the weak, challenging the strong, etc).
4. Make up a Trouble that will make it challenging to (or challenging _not_ to) use your cool stunt or fulfill your role in the situation you decided on.
6. Decide on a profession that would naturally complement or contrast the character's role or cool stunt. Make it into an aspect.
7. Ask the GM how someone in the setting might become a character similar to what you have outlined. Come up with at least 3 different ways your character could come about.
8. Settle on one of the identities you come up with as a final backstory. Use it to create 1 general purpose aspect, one more stunt, and to finalize your High Concept.
9. Reciprocate the setting.
