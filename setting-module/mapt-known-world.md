# Map't Known World

## The Braid

A series of worlds which have been merged in places. These have varying magical influences, races, and cultures. Each has a point around which their magical energy is centered. For most of them, this point is where the worlds are fully merged, forming an enormous shared city of sorts.

### Bora

Bora is characterized by vast oceans and 100 year old storms. Magic permeates the sun, the stars, and the air. It physically manifests in _feather ore_, dragons, and ancient metal artifacts lost beneath the sea.

### Vesa

Vesa branches out into vast rustic frontiers. Magic is closely tied to nature and physical environment. It physically manifests in endless forests and plains, nature spirits, and dire animals.

### Curum

Curum is a realm with significantly less magic, and a focus on technology and labor. Its magic manifests primarily through its wildlife, enchantments, and in the _glow water_ which drives the denizens' many contraptions.

### Kaahi

Kaahi is a realm of contrasts. Its magic centers around the ancient walls and gates of its temples, castles, and manors. Magic here manifests through fire, blood, and transformative phases such as the moon or seasons.

### Aarn

Aarn is a lost realm.
