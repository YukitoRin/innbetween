# RPG is Different

One of the many nuances of storytelling that isn't immediately obvious _(though it seems that way once someone points it out)_ is that for every main character of a story, the author must construct a story arc.

Similarly, an obvious _(yet often overlooked)_ aspect of tabletop RPGs is the fact that every player is both an author and a main character. This is especially true of FATE.

The result can be beautiful, it can be messy, but most importantly: it can be directed.

In the next section I will try to explain two character creation philosophies, and some ways you can set yourself up for success (whether you are a player or a GM).
